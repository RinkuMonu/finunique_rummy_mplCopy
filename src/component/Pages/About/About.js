              <ul className="about-list mt-3 mb-3 ps-4">
                <li><b>Points Rummy –</b> A fast-paced game where each point has a predefined monetary value. Players compete to win by forming valid sets and sequences before their opponents. The game requires strategic thinking, quick decision-making, and a deep understanding of Rummy rules. Points Rummy is ideal for players who enjoy short, thrilling matches and want to test their skills in a high-intensity format against competitive opponents.</li>
                <li><b>Pool Rummy –</b> A game where players aim to reach the elimination limit, ensuring long and exciting gameplay. In Pool Rummy, participants pay an entry fee to join a pool, and the goal is to avoid reaching the predetermined point limit. The last player remaining in the game emerges as the winner. Pool Rummy requires a combination of skill, patience, and strategy to outlast competitors and claim victory in extended gameplay sessions.</li>
                <li>
                  <b>Deals Rummy – </b>A fixed number of deals are played, and the player with the highest chips wins. This format adds an element of structure to the traditional Rummy game, as participants compete over a specific number of rounds. Deals Rummy demands consistency and skill, as players must maximize their chip count throughout multiple rounds to secure a win. This format appeals to those who enjoy a structured yet competitive approach to Rummy.

              <ul className="about-list mt-3 mb-3 ps-4">
                <li><b>Texas Hold’em – </b> The most popular poker variant with strategic betting rounds. Players receive two hole cards and must make the best five-card hand using community cards. Texas Hold’em requires deep knowledge of hand rankings, betting strategies, and psychological gameplay. With multiple betting rounds, this game challenges players to read their opponents and make well-calculated decisions to maximize their chances of winning.
                </li>
                <li><b>PLO 4 (Pot Limit Omaha 4) –</b>A variant where players are dealt four hole cards, increasing strategic depth. Unlike Texas Hold’em, players must use exactly two hole cards and three community cards to form their hands. PLO 4 is a dynamic game that demands sharp analytical skills, precise hand selection, and a strong grasp of pot odds, making it a favorite among experienced poker players.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>PLO 5 (Pot Limit Omaha 5) – </b> A more complex version of PLO with five hole cards. With an extra card in hand, players have more potential combinations, making the game even more thrilling. PLO 5 requires an advanced understanding of hand strengths and opponent behavior. The additional hole card adds an extra layer of complexity, challenging players to think several moves ahead and adapt their strategies accordingly.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>PLO 6 (Pot Limit Omaha 6) – </b> A variant with six hole cards, adding more excitement and skill to the game. PLO 6 provides an action-packed poker experience where players must navigate an increased number of potential hand combinations. The game tests a player’s ability to assess risk, make strategic bets, and outplay their opponents in high-stakes situations. With its heightened strategic complexity, PLO 6 is a thrilling choice for poker enthusiasts.
